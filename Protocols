Before sending humans into the NFMT world add a chip to their right ear
Keep track of each human on the overworld
If a delivery man or another Admin entity is murdered or robbed send the revenger of blood after him to retrieve the stolen goods and punish the culprit 
If a human doesn't move for a day send a delivery man to check on him. 
The day after a new mechanic is implemented Admin_Postman entities are sent to inform the Human characters about it, the start with 
the humans closest to them and keep on moving to the ones that are further away until they inform all of this new mechanic.
