Before sending humans into the NFMT world add a chip to their right ear
Keep track of each human on the overworld
If a delivery man or another Admin entity is murdered or robbed send the revenger of blood after him to retrieve the stolen goods and punish the culprit 
If a human doesn't move for a day send a delivery man to check on him.
